## **Topic: Prosperity in the United States**
`````

# Inspiration
Many times within the past year(2020/2021) have found myself devistated by the present state of the world, or my perception of it, while still unable to seperate myself from the constant pull of ['doom scrolling'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling). While listening to one of my favorite podcasts I heard this quote by [Barack Obama](https://www.facebook.com/Channel4News/videos/obama-if-you-had-to-choose-a-moment-in-history-youd-choose/10155254872476939/).
*"If you had to choose one moment in history in which to be born, and you didn't know in advance whether you were going to be male or female, which country you were going to be from, what your status was, you'd choose right now...[the world has never been] "healthier, or wealthier, or better educated, or in many ways more tolerant, or less violent, than it is today."* 
This quote as well as a podcast made me want to look into the truth of this statement, and then to remind myself that what spurs growth is struggle.

# Goals
1. Combine the growth and decay of world concerns to gain insight on the United Statesâ€™ current overall position compared with the past. 
2. Show the dashboard user how the factors most important to them have changed over time.

# About the Visualization
1. To gain the maximum number of factors possible the visualization includes only 11 years of data. 
2. Directions for interactivity are included within the presentation. 
3. Page 3: Shows the rate at which each of the factors are changing year to year.<br>
- This chart will show what factors are getting better/worse most quickly, and if there are trends within years for growth.  <br>
4. Page 3: Shows the percent change accumulated over the time selection. <br>
- This chart best represents how much each factor has grown over time. <br>


# Questions to ask yourself:
1. For the Factors that you care about most, How have their rate of growth or decay changed over the years?
2. Are there trends to be found? Do the rates seem correlated with eachother?

# Things to Remember
1. The purpose is for you to explore for your own, individual, intrigue. 
2. All factors that affect change in the US are not analyzed in the data. 
3. All factors are not equal.
4. Currently only 11 years of data covered.

# The Data
1. Sources can be found [here](').
2. Caluclations used:<br>
    a. Rate = 'Current Year' / 'Previous Year' x 100
    b. Growth = ('Current Year' / 'Start Year(2016)')-1 x 100
